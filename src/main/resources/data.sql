    ('Carlos P. Romulo', 'I am a Filipino–inheritor of a glorious past, hostage to the uncertain future. As such I must prove equal to a two-fold task–the task of meeting my responsibility to the past, and the task of performing my obligation to the future.\n\nI sprung from a hardy race, child many generations removed of ancient Malayan pioneers. Across the centuries the memory comes rushing back to me: of brown-skinned men putting out to sea in ships that were as frail as their hearts were stout. Over the sea I see them come, borne upon the billowing wave and the whistling wind, carried upon the mighty swell of hope–hope in the free abundance of new land that was to be their home and their children’s forever.\n\nThis is the land they sought and found. Every inch of shore that their eyes first set upon, every hill and mountain that beckoned to them with a green-and-purple invitation, every mile of rolling plain that their view encompassed, every river and lake that promised a plentiful living and the fruitfulness of commerce, is a hallowed spot to me.\n\nBy the strength of their hearts and hands, by every right of law, human and divine, this land and all the appurtenances thereof–the black and fertile soil, the seas and lakes and rivers teeming with fish, the forests with their inexhaustible wealth in wild life and timber, the mountains with their bowels swollen with minerals–the whole of this rich and happy land has been, for centuries without number, the land of my fathers. This land I received in trust from them and in trust will pass it to my children, and so on until the world is no more.\n\nI am a Filipino. In my blood runs the immortal seed of heroes–seed that flowered down the centuries in deeds of courage and defiance. In my veins yet pulses the same hot blood that sent Lapulapu to battle against the first invader of this land, that nerved Lakandula in the combat against the alien foe, that drove Diego Silang and Dagohoy into rebellion against the foreign oppressor.\n\nThat seed is immortal. It is the self-same seed that flowered in the heart of Jose Rizal that morning in Bagumbayan when a volley of shots put an end to all that was mortal of him and made his spirit deathless forever, the same that flowered in the hearts of Bonifacio in Balintawak, of Gergorio del Pilar at Tirad Pass, of Antonio Luna at Calumpit; that bloomed in flowers of frustration in the sad heart of Emilio Aguinaldo at Palanan, and yet burst forth royally again in the proud heart of Manuel L. Quezon when he stood at last on the threshold of ancient Malacañan Palace, in the symbolic act of possession and racial vindication.\n\nThe seed I bear within me is an immortal seed. It is the mark of my manhood, the symbol of dignity as a human being. Like the seeds that were once buried in the tomb of Tutankhamen many thousand years ago, it shall grow and flower and bear fruit again. It is the insignia of my race, and my generation is but a stage in the unending search of my people for freedom and happiness.\n\nI am a Filipino, child of the marriage of the East and the West. The East, with its languor and mysticism, its passivity and endurance, was my mother, and my sire was the West that came thundering across the seas with the Cross and Sword and the Machine. I am of the East, an eager participant in its spirit, and in its struggles for liberation from the imperialist yoke. But I also know that the East must awake from its centuried sleep, shake off the lethargy that has bound his limbs, and start moving where destiny awaits.\n\nFor I, too, am of the West, and the vigorous peoples of the West have destroyed forever the peace and quiet that once were ours. I can no longer live, a being apart from those whose world now trembles to the roar of bomb and cannon-shot. I cannot say of a matter of universal life-and-death, of freedom and slavery for all mankind, that it concerns me not. For no man and no nation is an island, but a part of the main, there is no longer any East and West–only individuals and nations making those momentous choices which are the hinges upon which history resolves.\n\nAt the vanguard of progress in this part of the world I stand–a forlorn figure in the eyes of some, but not one defeated and lost. For, through the thick, interlacing branches of habit and custom above me, I have seen the light of the sun, and I know that it is good. I have seen the light of justice and equality and freedom, my heart has been lifted by the vision of democracy, and I shall not rest until my land and my people shall have been blessed by these, beyond the power of any man or nation to subvert or destroy.\n\nI am a Filipino, and this is my inheritance. What pledge shall I give that I may prove worthy of my inheritance? I shall give the pledge that has come ringing down the corridors of the centuries, and it shall be compounded of the joyous cries of my Malayan forebears when first they saw the contours of this land loom before their eyes, of the battle cries that have resounded in every field of combat from Mactan to Tirad Pass, of the voices of my people when they sing:\n\nLand of the morning,\nChild of the sun returning–\nNe’er shall invaders\nTrample thy sacred shore.\n\nOut of the lush green of these seven thousand isles, out of the heartstrings of sixteen million people all vibrating to one song, I shall weave the mighty fabric of my pledge. Out of the songs of the farmers at sunrise when they go to labor in the fields, out of the sweat of the hard-bitten pioneers in Mal-lig and Koronadal, out of the silent endurance of stevedores at the piers and the ominous grumbling of peasants in Pampanga, out of the first cries of babies newly born and the lullabies that mothers sing, out of the crashing of gears and the whine of turbines in the factories, out of the crunch of plough-shares upturning the earth, out of the limitless patience of teachers in the classrooms and doctors in the clinics, out of the tramp of soldiers marching, I shall make the pattern of my pledge:\n\n“I am a Filipino born to freedom, and I shall not rest until freedom shall have been added unto my inheritance—for myself and my children and my children’s children—forever.”', 'philippines filipino freedom east west heroes nationalism nature', '1941-08-16'),
    ('Ramon Magsaysay', 'TEN years ago today, by the grace of God, we realized a dream for which Filipinos had fought and died for hundred of years. On that day was born the Republic of the Philippines, a sovereign nation of free and independent Filipinos. The road we traveled to reach that goal was long and hard. On that road our fathers and their fathers before them fought and died. During the past half century the end of that hard road came in sight. The marks of our struggle changed from blood and steel to persuasion and principle. Our final victory was won with reason rather than violence.\n\nAt the turn of the century, we shook off the grip of one foreign country only to come under the sovereignty of another. Fortunately, the new sovereign was a nation which held and still holds the freedom and dignity of man among its most cherished traditions. Within the framework of this tradition we developed our case for self-determination and independence. Our case prospered. And on July 4, 1946, in an atmosphere of mutual respect and warm friendship, the stars and stripes of America were lowered; and the flag of our Republic proclaimed to the world that we stood at last as a free and sovereign people in the community of nations.\n\nNow, after ten years, let us look back over the road we have traveled. Let us take stock of ourselves. What have we done with that Independence for which we waited so long? Let us look clearly and honestly at the record.\n\nI can tell you how I feel about it. I can tell you that I am proud of my race, that I am proud of my generation, that I am proud of the nation we created in so short a time and in the face of such tremendous odds.\n\nThere is no need for me to recall the details of our beginning. Even the younger among us have vivid memories of of the destructive war which still echoed in our ears as our nation was born. That disaster wrecked our plans and our very means of livelihood, destroyed our homes, and left us with only a crushing burden of corruption and immorality-inevitable by-products of war. I recall these painful memories because only against such background can we truly appreciate the feat of nation-building which we have accomplished.\n\nThere are those among us who cry out against our social and economic situation, who predict disaster, and who clamor for quick remedies. Let them not blind us to the facts. Let them not minimize the fact that our production levels today are above pre-war levels, as are the living standards of our people. Let them not exploit the discontent of those who are still poor, those whom we have not yet reached with our efforts to improve living conditions. Let them not obscure such advances in social justice as our labor legislation and our tenancy laws, our rural credit and cooperative institutions. By obscuring and decrying they but make our task the harder and postpone its completion. Let them shout and work for more, but let them not deny the accomplishment.\n\nThere are some among us who wring their hands over our political system and urge us to experiment with other forms. I am one of those who feel at times that we exaggerate the importance of politics. But let us not ignore the fact that in a period of great world tension and crisis, when other and older nations were gravely endangered and damaged, our system survived its crisis, demonstrating the superiority and stability of our form of democracy in the face of armed attack and sabotage by the Communist conspiracy.\n\nHabit is strong. So long and passionate was our fight for independence and sovereignty that some among us have not been able to adjust themselves to reality and they continue to beat the dead horse. Ignoring the real problems of the present, they now seek to give fresh vigor to an old lament—that our independence is not real or complete. The test of our independence is in whether or not the initiative for guiding our destiny rests within our own powers, in whether or not the acceptance or rejection of a relationship with another nation is ours to decide, subject only to the national interest. As your Chief Executive, I say to you: This initiative we possess and exercise: we will never relinquish it.\n\nEvery relationship in which we are today engaged has been and continues to be carefully weighed against one major standard: Does it in the final total contribute positively to the national interest?\n\nWhat comprises the national interest? Security, first of all. Without security, sovereignty is controlled by, and at the mercy of, the nearest aggressor, making it no sovereignty at all. Next comes the material well-being of our people and our progress in maintaining and expanding that well-being. Those are the tangible, the physical elements of national interest. But no less important, certainly, are those aspects of the national interest which cannot be measured in pesos or in fire-power, such elements as our racial and national code of ethics, morality, and justice; our principles and ideals; our reputation and prestige as a member of the free world community. Determined, for instance, to honor our commitments and conduct ourselves nationally in a manner that does credit to our national dignity.\n\nTested by these criteria, our Republic has good reason for pride, satisfaction, and confidence. But this is no excuse for relaxing our vigilance or our effort. Our accomplishment was good, but it could have been better. Many old problems remain; new problems arise daily. Our success should serve only to give us confidence and incentive for, greater effort.\n\nAs we review our past and look to our future, we are happy to welcome to our festivities Vice-President Richard Nixon of the United States of America. Vice-President Nixon is here to represent during this celebration the country with which we have cooperated so much in the past and with which we will continue to cooperate in the future for the cause of peace and freedom. Our partnership in this cause, based on mutual respect and understanding, is naturally viewed with disfavor by those who do not wish to see peace and freedom secure in this part of the world. It is for this very reason that this partnership must continue. But it is also for this reason that we must so maintain it and so adjust our relations to our mutual requirements that our partnership becomes a model of collective action for liberty rather than a source of doubt among the uncommitted countries or of substance for the propaganda of the enemies of liberty. I am certain that this second visit of Vice-President Nixon, whose own personal interest in Philippine-American understanding is widely known, will contribute immeasurably towards that end.\n\nAnd now, fellow countrymen, what of our future?\n\nOn several occasions in recent months I have urged our people toward greater expression of what I have called positive nationalism. Just what do I mean by positive nationalism? Actually, I could just as accurately say true nationalism. For example, I see no real patriotic or constructive contribution from those who resurrect buried enemies or revive dead issues, from those who sneer at the worth or validity of our national institutions or culture, from those who try to imprison us behind a wall of suspicion, distrust, and hatred of the outside world, from those who would have us follow a policy of cynical expediency. Honest and fearless criticism should be welcomed as a healthy manifestation of democracy, but we should insist that it be presented soberly, based upon evidence, and accompanied by a constructive alternative.\n\nPositive or true nationalism is that which places the national good above personal interest, bias, or prejudices. It seeks, discloses, and cultivates what is good in the community and the nation, knowing that the stronger growth of what is good will choke out the weeds of what is bad. The true nationalist does not ignore or conceal national shortcomings, but works hard to correct them; he does not advertise them to feed his own vanity.\n\nThese are some of the qualities of the true or positive nationalist. You will agree that they coincide with the traditional virtues of our race. I would like to see the day when only those who practice them faithfully are permitted the honor of being called nationalists.\n\nThe world in which we enter the second decade of the history of our republic is still a troubled world. Our course continues to be perilous. We may yet lose everything we hold dear should we become careless or relax our effort. But of this I feel sure: If freedom is destined to survive at all upon this earth, I have the fullest faith and confidence that we Filipinos have the wisdom and energy which, with Divine grace and guidance, will keep us securely on our course.', 'philippines filipino america freedom politics', '1956-07--04'),
    ('Martin Luther King Jr', 'I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the colored America is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the colored American is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.\n\nOne hundred years later, the colored American lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the colored American is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we have come to our Nation’s Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.\n\nThis note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked “insufficient funds.”\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to his hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.\n\nNow is the time to make real the promise of democracy.\n\nNow it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.\n\nNow it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.\n\nNow is the time to make justice a reality to all of God’s children.\n\nI would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it’s colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the colored people’s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the colored Americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.\n\nThere will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person’s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.\n\nWe can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating “for white only.”\n\nWe cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in Mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.\n\nNo, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.\n\nYou have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.\n\nGo back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.\n\nLet us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.\n\nI still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.\n\nI have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n\nI have a dream today.\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.\n\nWith this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\n\nWith this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.\n\nThis will be the day when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father’s died, land of the Pilgrim’s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!”\n\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.\n\nLet freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.\n\nLet freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.\n\nLet freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.\n\nBut not only that, let freedom, ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.\n\nLet freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi and every mountainside.\n\nWhen we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, “Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.”', 'america freedom equality civil rights hope', '1963-08-28'),
